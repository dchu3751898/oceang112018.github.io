				<h2>Personal Information</h2>
			</header>
			<p>Name: Lachlan Augello </br>
			Age: 20 </br>
			Student number: 3743724 </br>
			E-mail address: lachlanaugello2@gmail.com. The first one was somehow taken >:( </br>
			My mum is Scottish/Australian, while my dad hails from Italy, but I definitely think of myself as Australian.</br>
			I have completed VCE after studying english, mathematical methods, chemistry, psychology and theatre studies(quite the eclectic mix, I'll give you that).</br>
			I also did a semester of arts/laws at Australian Catholic University before deciding it wasn't for me.</br>
			I have a few pets: a black Persian called "Kitty" because we couldn't decide what to call him; a massive pure-bred black German shepherd named "Max",</br>
			comedically contrasted by a tiny Pomeranian-looking mongrel affectionately named "Jeff" after that stupid scene in 22 Jump street; and 4 chickens.</br>
			I spend a lot of time playing video games, whether it be on PC or xbox, which segues nicely into my next topic.</p>

				<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
			</header>
			<p> I suppose my interest began when I first saw my dad using his huge block of a desktop computer for work about 16 years ago. I'd never seen anything </br>
			like it, even though I'd watched tv before, but at that age I didn't really think about the similarities or complex workings, and just thought "the tv </br>
			puts on stuff and I watch it." Seeing the computer and all the things he was doing on it(in retrospect it was probably just spreadsheet data entry or </br>
			something similarly uninteresting by nowaday's standards) just blew me away, and when I found out you could play games on it(he had the original Call of </br>
 			Duty on it) I was hooked. My parents got me the orignal xbox for my 5th birthday and my interest in tech went off from there. Technology was already </br>
			interlinked with society by then(computer labs at school, having to print off typed assignments instead of writing them manually, etc.) so it's not like </br>
			I had to go out of my way to show an interest in computers.</p>
			<p> About a year ago I went to a mate's place to hang out and he was in the middle of putting together a computer using parts cannibalised from other rigs,</br>
			to sell for a profit. I was pretty impressed with his ability and wanted to learn more, so I started searching on the internet over the next few days, at </br>
			first about hardware but then pretty much anything to do with computers. I found it a little too difficult to understand, but I was hooked all the same,</br>
			and decided that the best thing for me was to study Info Tech(I chose RMIT because it looked like it had the right level of tech-focus, and honestly,</br>
			I have a good number of friends here that spoke nothing but praise about it). I expect to learn how the hardware that makes up a computer actually works </br>
			at a scientific and technical level, and gain a proper understanding of progamming techniques.</br>

				<h2>My Ideal Job</h2>
			</header>
			<p><a>https://www.seek.com.au/job/36999060?type=standard</a></br>
			<img src="idealjob.jpg"></p>
			<p>The advertisement is looking for a software developer to work in a group creating software to aid finance companies such as accounting firms. It also wants</br>
			someone with good communication skills as the job also includes online/over-the-phone tech support. I think this is a very good starting point for a career in</br>
			the tech industry because you're a junior member of a team that will be working to complete the tasks, so you don't have to be experienced in the industry</br>
			(it's a good starting point). I also like that it includes tech support as most of my jobs have been in retail and hospitality before so I'm comfortable talking</br>
			to customers. The job allows you to be independent, which is good for me as I usually don't like a little autonomy when working. It also offers full training and</br>
			mentoring so the applicant becomes fully able to work on their own and be prepared for the future, which is definitely a bonus.</p>
			<p>There are no experience requirements for this job, which is ideal as it means it's the sort you can apply for straight out of university. It does require</br>
			experience with and understanding of multiple web/programming languages(Python, SQL, JQuery, Javascript, HTML, XML, Excel, Apache, and IIS). It also asks for</br>
			strong mathematical prowess and skill in Microsoft Word+Powerpoint and PDF editing. Understanding of the software development life cycle is also mentioned.</p>
			<p>Currently I am severely lacking in the required skills, as I have very limited understanding of Java and HTML5, and none with the others. This will obviously</br>
			change as I progress in my IT degree, but I must definitely at least google search the other languages mentioned to gain a simple understanding of the differences</br>
			and strengths they have. I am however, proficient in mathematical methods, editing PDFs and the use of the Microsoft Office suite. I must also research the</br>
			"software development life cycle" as I am currently totally unfamiliar with the term or what it means.</p>
			<p>After a cursory look into the systems development life cycle on wikipedia, I can safely say I require a significantly longer time period to read and understand</br>
			this term, as well as how relevant it actually is to the job. It appears to simply be an order of steps in which one takes in creating a software system, but from</br>
			the length of the article, its clearly more in-depth than that. I suspect that, as well as more comprehensively teaching me the use of Javascript and HMTL, the</br>
			degree I'm currently doing (Bachelor of I.T.) will probably delve into this term somewhat, so I'll say finishing this course will fulfil many of the requirements</br>
			of this job. I'm sure not all of the aforementioned progamming languages are required for this job, which is suppose necessitates an E-mail or call to the company</br>
			asking such, as the advertisement simply references "the ideal" applicant, which is likely to overspecify/qualify.

			<p>Myers-Briggs test</br>

			<p>Learning styles test</br>
			<img src="learningstyle.jpg"></p>
			<p>Big Five personality test</br>
			<img src="big5.jpg"></p>
			<p>The results from the Myers-Briggs test suggested the "mediator" personality (INFP, -A/-T). This suggests that I am not the most open to those i don't know, but</br>
			feel free to share their feelings to smaller groups and are more likely to use metaphor and reference fiction/texts when expressing themselves.</br>
			The learning styles test concluded that I'm a visual learner. I find it easier to remember things by looking at them and then thinking about them in my head; I</br>
			tend to watch videos or play video games in my spare time; I like diagrams over walls of text.</br>
			The Big Five test determined that I am open to new and different ideas, disposed towards abstract and complex thinking, but also am impulsive and prone to</br>
			distraction. I prefer spontaneity and flexibility over planning and rigidity.</br>
			When forming a group I should take into account that:
 			  <ul>
				<li>I tend to open up to certain people but not others, so I should find people I am comfortable with.</li>
				<li>I work better with people who use diagrams,flowcharts, and mind maps to convey information.</li>
				<li>I choose people who also prefer to work independently and do their own thing as opposed to being constantly overseen.</li>

				<h2>My Project Ideas</h2>
			</header>
			<p>Overview</br>
			I think it would be amazing to make a webpage that explains what sort of computer you should buy. It gives you all the information required for building your own</br>
			 desktop computer, featuring a set of questions and tickboxes that ask things like what you're going to be using it for, whether it is going to be your only PC, and what</br>
			your budget is, and then accurately provides a list of parts optimal for your needs. In the case of the consumer needing a laptop, it could ask similar questions</br>
			and then determine the recommended hardware specifications.</p>
			<p>Motivation</br>
			My mate and I recently built me a new computer, and deciding what parts to use, was actually quite a significant task, and thats with our expertise in PC hardware.</br>
			I've also had a surprisingly large number of friends and acquaintances who wanted to build a PC but didn't possess the knowledge and so wasted money on a pre-built</br>
			rig, or bought a laptop based on price range but didn't actually need to spend how much they did because they didn't know enough about the hardware to know what</br>
			specs they needed. Some (usually gamers) would make their own PCs, but significantly overspent on buying the highest-end GPUs and overclockable processors when they</br>
			ended up using the computer to do simple uni work or at best play low hardware-requirement games like League of Legends or DotA.</p>
			<p>Description</br>
			The website's goal is to provide you with an accurate and detailed description of the hardware required for your ideal personal computer. As such, It must ask the</br>
			user a set of questions, starting with:</br>
			Do you need a laptop, or would you prefer a desktop?</br>
			It would then ask the consumer to tick the things they will be doing on the computer, using a list of things the person could do, from low- to high-end requirements.</br>
			Something like:</br>
			Please choose the things you will be doing with this computer:</br>
			Browsing social media and simple webpages y/n </br>
			Low-end text/visual programs such as Microsoft Word/Powerpoint/Outlook/Excel y/n </br>
			Low-end gaming(flash games, MOBAs, etc)  Each one of these will be hyperlinked to an exhaustive list of games and websites that correlate to them </br>
			High-end gaming(graphics-intensive, large-scale online) y/n Hyperlinked as above.</br>
			Video streaming(upload) y/n </br>
			Video streaming(download) such as netflix, youtube, twitch.tv y/n </br>
			Rendering y/n </br>
			3D-modelling y/n </br>
			Programming y/n </br>
			You get the picture. Then the results of this will go most of the way towards determinining the parts required. It will then ask other things like:</br>
			Is it for work, personal use or both?</br>
			How much time will it be active(not idle) per day? | 1-2 | 2-4 | 4-6 | 6-9 | 9+ |</br>
			How often do you upgrade? Every: | I don't know | year or less | 1-2 yrs | 2-5 yrs | 5+ yrs | The "I don't know" option will offer a link to an explanation of how</br>
			quickly new parts come out, general warranties and lasting times of parts based on their answer to how often they used their PC</br>
			After the user has answered all the questions, the webpage generates a list of parts that are optimal for them(as well as prices. It also gives an explanation at</br>
			the end as to the reasoning behind the choices, and has a button to bump the specs up or down if they don't like the price, or if they arbitrarily decide they want</br>
			it a bit more higher- or lower-end(the customer is always right). This is all from an algorithm made with Javascript or similar that uses answers as variables to direct</br>
			the results of the consumer's actions. This is working in the background throughout the experience collecting all the responses and following a flowchart to draw the</br>
			results. The rest is just grunt work such as updating the algorithm and parts list/database explanations when new hardware becomes available.</p>
			<p>Tools and Technologies</br>
			Most of the tech required for this idea is actually pretty simple(at least, from my less-than-complex knowledge of programming). You can format it to look clean and</br>
			fancy and colourful, use tickboxes, dropdown option boxes, hyperlinks etc. just with HTML5. Then there's the algorithm which requires a programming language such as</br>
			JavaScript. You would also need a server to hold the database of all the information you're providing(the comprehensive information on the intended use and</br>
			longevity of parts, information on different companies and how often they change slots, etc)</p>
			<p>Skills Required</br>
			A comprehensive understanding of HTML5(or any other web-programming language) would be necessary to build and maintain the site, as well as social skills competent</br>
			enough to explain complex ideas in simple enough ways for anyone to understand, as well as a strong knowledge of computer hardware and software(so you're actually</br>
			giving accurate information about system requirements/workload etc). This would also be necessary to work and maintain the server. You would also need an adept</br>
			understanding of JavaScript or choice programming language as mentioned before to build the algorithm and also change it when new parts come out.</p>
			<p>Outcome</br>
			The intended outcome of this project is that people building their own computers/buying laptops will only spend the money they have to, and that they can feel</br>
			comfortable knowing why they bought each part and how long the parts will last, or that they're not using a laptop significantly more expensive than they need. This</br>
			is because of the comprehensive questions asked by the site and the information provided by each link. It would hopefully lead to more general knowledge and</br>
			understanding of computers as people think more about their purchases in future, and also recommend the site to others.</p>
