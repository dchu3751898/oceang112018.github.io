<h1>Interest In Information Technology</h1>
  My interest in Information Techonology is Cyber Security. My interest for Cyber Security started when I was 13 years old.
When I was playing a First Person Shooting game online, there were many hackers. They would cheat to win the game. I was really upset
and from that day onwards, I wanted to pursue Cyber Security so that I can prevent hackers from hacking not only the game, but any program.

<p>

  I chose to come and study at RMIT Melbourne because I feel like RMIT provides the best education for technology and hands-on work.
  During my study time in RMIT, I expect to learn many things such as coding, programming, creating websites and many more.

</p>

<p>

  The results of these tests mean that I am sometimes quite a shy person and I don't really start conversations unless needed.
  These results may cause me to change the way I talk or even the way I act around people. I will try harder to make conversations
  with the team and also be more relax around more people.

</p>
<p>

  The way I take this into account when forming a team is that I should talk and communicate more with team members. Besides that, I
  need to feel more comfortable when working around a group of people to prevent any sort of feeling of uncomfortableness.

<h1> My Project Idea </h1>

My project idea is a Grocery Shopping App on mobile phones. The Grocery Shopping is an application that allow users to buy
groceries online without having them to actually go to the supermarket. Users will need to login into the system before they can view
any groceries and add them to their shopping cart. After they're done, they can place the order by making a safe payment via Debit Card,
Credit Card or PayPal. The orders will be recorded in a wide server in the web. This application is available in the AppStore and also
Google PlayStore.
</p>

<p>
I came out with this idea when I was doing grocery shopping myself. I was lazy to walk out and buy the groceries. So I thought to myself,
what if there is an application that allow users to buy groceries online and collect it whenever they like or even get it delivered to
their home. So I went home and search for this type of applications. There was not much online so I told myself I wanted to create this
application in the future. Besides that, my parents always have to walk a certain distance to buy groceries when I'm in school. After walking
that far, they will feel tired. So I think this application will come in handy in the future and it will help many people save time
and also save energy.
</p>


<h1> Description of my project idea </h1>

<p>
This application name will be Smart Market. It will be programmed with a user-friendly and eye-catching interface. This application
will allow the users to buy and place an order of groceries through the application. This application will be connected to many supermarkets
such as Coles, Woolworths, Metro, Asian groceries shop and many more. The way this application works is that when the users open the application,
they will be asked to login into an account or sign up. After that, it will bring them to a page of selecting a language they would like to use.
After selecting the language, the application will show different supermarkets. This is where the users will choose which supermarket they
would like to do the grocery shopping at. Upon selecting the supermarket, they can do their groceries online. After finishing ordering,
they will be a button at the bottom right saying "Add to Cart". Once the user selects "Add to Cart", the order will be saved and stored
securely in a server. Then, the user will be asked to key in their Credit Card details, or any type of payment choice they prefer.
After finishing the payment step, there will be an estimated time for the groceries to be ready for collection. If the user is busy to collect,
they is a delivery option. It will cost a normal rate of $5 AUD. If the user signs up for premium membership of the application, the delivery
will be free of charge. The premium membership will cost $10 AUD per month.
</p>

<p>

This application target users of age 18 or above. This is because it requires a type of payment information in order to sign up. Users
below the age of 18 can still use the application provided their parents or guardian give them access and permission to the the credit
card, debit card or the type of payment they are using.

</p>

<p>
This application has many advantages but we found one disadvantage that might affect the order. The advantages are the users do not have
to wait in long queues to buy groceries. Secondly, users can purchase the groceries anytime and anywhere they like. This application
does not require users to go to the supermarket. This application is available for free download as long as your mobile phone has
App Store or Google Play Store. This application is also easy to navigate and easy to access. All the details and buttons will be
clearly shown for users to click. This will prevent errors or users from getting lost in the application. The only disadvantage is that
the quality of the product may differ from users choosing it at the store.
</p>

<p>
<h1> Tools and Technologies </h1>
  The softwares needed to create this application are Eclipse, Branch, GitHub. There are still many more programs needed to make this
  application. I am still currently finding more programs that are suitable for this application.

</p>

<p>
  Eclipse is an integrated development environment (IDE). It is used in computer programming. Eclipse is the most used Java IDE.
  Eclipse is a suitable choice as it allows user to write codes in Java and it is use for developing Java applications.
</p>

<p>
  Branch is one of the best mobile marketing and linking platform. Branch is a good program to boost your application growth within
  a short period of time.
</p>

<p>
  GitHub is web-based hosting service. GitHub is used mostly for computing coding. The reason I chose GitHub as one of the programs
  I would use to make my grocery application is that not only I get to code for the application, I also get to create a website for
  my application. This website is to promote and advertise my application to the world. Advertisement is a very good way to get attention
  of users all around the world.
</p>

<p>
<h1> Skills Required for my project </h1>

There are many skill-sets required for this project. One must be able to code excellently and carefully in order to prevent time wastage.
Besides that, one must be able to debug the program when an error or issue arises. Another skill required is that one must have enough
knowledge and understanding of how the program should work. Without understanding the program, it is hard to write codes or programs
needed to function the application.

</p>

<p>
  A very important skill required is excellent communication skills. To create this application, we will be working in teams.
  Communication among team members is very crucial. It builds trust and a good foundation among the members. With good communication
  skills, it will be very easy to talk to each other about the application. When a problem arises, the team can work together to fix it
  as soon as possible. The working environment will also be less tense and less awkward if all team members possess good communication
  skills.

</p>

<p>
<h1> Outcome </h1>

If the application is a success, the outcome will be of course a very proud and satisfied team of talented programmers.
Besides that, people all over the world can happily use the application. When the customers/users feel very satisfied and they give
very positive reviews,that is the best feeling in the world any working adult could ask for.

</p>

<p>
  Another outcome if the application is a success it that it could change the way people do grocery shopping. People can do
  it anytime and anywhere. Supermarkets will still be open for people who wishes to do their grocery shopping my themselves.
