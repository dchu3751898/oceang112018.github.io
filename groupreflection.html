                        "Ocean", a name which has depths of intelligence and dedication in it. A group which gives flexibility in work and has wonderful reflexes. We as a group is loveable and enjoyable to work with. Each member is unique in their own ways. Like the previous one, our meetings went well, and everyone is very responsive to each questions and problems. We could have improved in several areas, like being much more effective when it comes to work as a team together so that we could finish the work much faster consuming less time. As we had different timetable, so it was a bit difficult for us to sit together and do our work most of the time, doing our work together could have been much better and less time consuming. Other than that, we were okay and very satisfied with all our work. The most surprising part is we finished the work in time even though we had medical issues including me and other issues regarding having free time to meet as well as having final exams at different dates before the assignment, so we had to keep contact mostly through social media (Facebook). But as we worked hard individually so we managed to complete all our work within the given time. Daniel lead us perfectly and everyone responded him very well. We did what we were asked to do. From this group the one thing we learned is that even though we have hurdles and issues in our daily life if we are responsive, serious and focused on our own work, we can complete it in time together with great communication skills and a positive mindset from anywhere around the world as a group. We never faced any problems or were pressurised to do anything that wasn’t meant to be done for the assignment. It was a great experience together doing the work and enjoying it most of the time doing every work. We look forward to continuing doing more projects and tech stuffs together even if we don’t have the same course in future we will keep building ourselves together learning new innovative stuff later which will help us in our career down the path.

                      Would love to say that my group were a real pleasure to work with! Splitting work individually to everyone has been quite easy. We couldn’t meet up as a group as much as there were issues beyond our control, but all ends well as every single one of us was able to get our work done on time with just one meeting. We do try to meet at least once a week. Really appreciate all my members being proactive and really contributed much to this assignment. Looking forward on passing this unit together and meeting them in the future units if we do come across it. This is by far one of the best groups I’ve worked with everyone did their part as they were told to and never was there a huge issue that we as a group couldn’t solve. Clear communication has always played a huge part in this group.

                      We as a group came together efficiently. Daniel was very good with setting out what each person should do, and everyone just sort of… did it. It was excellent. I supposed we could have started the assignment earlier, but it’s hard to lay blame for that as we had to worry about our final exams, a problem which everyone was facing as the due week and exam week has been the same. It was also a little troublesome getting the entire group together at times, as everyone has a different timetable to maintain in their daily life. I am to blame for as well, but honestly it wasn’t an issue, the job got done. I was surprised with how easy the group came together and just did their work, there was no real trouble with workload arguing or people avoiding effort. After the troubles with group assignments I (and I’m sure everyone else has) had in the past, I’ve learned from this assignment that sometimes it can work. We even had plenty of troubles with people being ill and the exam week issue, but it really didn’t matter, in the end, I certainly didn’t feel pressured at all or anything like that. It was fun working together with these bunch of skilled people and I would gladly work again with them in the future if possible.

                      This has been an interesting assignment so far. Doing assignments for this course I got to have some wonderful friends, the group work has been fantastic, everyone is very friendly, responsive and hard working. I myself put up a decent effort to help my group in every way possible for both the assignments. I am pretty much new in this environment had a tough time to cover up the studies and every other things to get settled here outside home. My group members have been very cooperative and helped me with guidelines for the assignments for which, I could do my part of the job perfectly and comfortably. We were connected in social media (facebook) through which we discussed almost everyday bit by bit about our work and responsibilities for the assignment. We had a group meeting as well in which we each gave 4 hours of our time. I have tried my best to help my members out with my hard work. Working with this group under great minds and leadership I had a fantastic experience and would like to continue doing work for this group with these people if possible in the upcoming future.

                      I would first like to start by saying that working with my group has been an enjoyable and new experience for me. Although we started working on the assignment late due to a couple of issues, we managed to complete the assignment without much problems. I would like to thank Daniel as he filled me in with what the group was doing when I was sick. Besides that, I felt that he did not give me any pressure to complete the work and that was very relieving for me. We did most of our communication through Facebook to discuss about the assignment. I believe that everyone played a huge role in helping to complete this assignment. This has been one of the better groups I have worked with during my time studying in RMIT and I would love to complete any other projects with the same group if I have a chance in the future.

                        In my opinion, the group functioned well albeit some delays with starting the assignments. The assignment was able to be completed on time although we had very few group meetings and discussions were mostly done on Facebook. Although I’ve missed a few classes, Daniel was able to get me up to date and explain the work required for my part in the assignment, making it less stressful for me as I have other assignments that are due on the same week. Everyone communicated and worked together well with one another to complete the assignment on time. Daniel was a big help to the group as he was able to organise everyone and delegate task to each individual. This is one of the better group that I have worked with so far in my 3 years in university and I’m looking forward to working together with the group to complete further works or projects in the future if possible.

                      I had a good experience working with this group. One of my fellow groupmates is from Malaysia, which is my home country. So, I felt comfortable when joining the group. At first, I was late to join the group because I was absent from class when the group was formed. Nonetheless, everyone was welcoming from the very beginning. We had a great journey together this semester. After the last assignment I was pretty sure that this group has something great to offer and everyone is so responsive and talented. Like the last assignment, everyone was given a task to complete. We helped each other with the assignment. Everyone was very hardworking in doing their task. I was given the tasks to find out the risks involving in the project and also to find out the people with skills for the project outcome if we were to fund by venture capitalists and also I had to come up with a team profile. End of the day I did all my given tasks and was helped by my teammates in every steps. I had fun working with this group and looking forward to work as a whole in different other projects if I have a chance in the future
