                        "Ocean", a name which has depths of intelligence and dedication in it. A group which gives flexibility in work and has wonderful reflexes. We as a group is loveable and enjoyable to work with. Each members are unique in their own ways. For this assignment each of our meetings went well and every one is very responsive to each questions and problems. We could have improved in several areas like being much more effective when it comes to work as a team so that we could finish the work much faster consuming less time. Other than that we were okay and very satisfied with all of our work. The most surprising part is we finished the work in time even though we had medical issues including me and other issues regarding having free time to meet together. But as we worked hard individually so we managed to complete all our work within the given time. Daniel lead us perfectly and everyone responded him very well. We did what we were asked to do. From this group the one thing we learned is that even though we have hurdles and issues in our daily life if we are responsive, serious and focused on our work we can complete it in time together with great communication skills from anywhere around the world as a group. We never faced any problems or were pressurised to do anything that wasn’t meant to be done for the assignment. It was a great experience together doing the work and enjoying it almost relaxing all the time doing every work from home. We are looking forward to work together on every other projects and assignments we need to deal with in future and overcome all the obstacles that are about to come in the upcoming days.

                        First of all, I would love to say that my group are a real pleasure to work with! We had a small issue regarding the phantom seventh member, which was my fault to start off with, so instead we started off the assignment one week later. After that issue was settled everyone went on high gear, as we were running out of time we had no choice but to split work individually so that everyone can work at their own accord without waiting on others to complete a certain part of the same topic. The section of work was given depending on the strength of each member and fairly among the group members. We couldn’t meet up as a group as there were issues beyond our control, but all ends well as every single one of us was able to get our work done on time with just one meeting. This is by far one of the best groups I’ve worked with everyone did their part as they were told to and never was there a huge issue that we as a group couldn’t solve. Clear communication has always played a huge part in this group.

                        I think after our 7 person group fiasco, we came together pretty efficiently. Daniel was very good with setting out what each person should do, and everyone just sort of… did it. It was excellent. 
                        I supposed we could have started the assignment earlier, but it’s hard to lay blame for that as we had to worry about our group size, a problem which was only solved just over a week before the due date. It was also a little troublesome getting the entire group together at times. I am to blame for as well, but honestly it wasn’t an issue, the job got done. 
                        I was surprised with how easy the group came together and just did their work, there was no real trouble with workload arguing or people avoiding effort. 
                        After the troubles with group assignments I (and I’m sure everyone else has) had in the past, I’ve learned from this assignment that sometimes it can work. We even had plenty of troubles with people being ill and the aforementioned group size issue, but it really didn’t matter, in the end, I certainly didn’t feel pressured at all or anything like that.

                        This has been an interesting assignment so far. Through this assignment I made friends, the group work has been fantastic, everyone is very friendly, responsive and hard working. I myself put up a decent effort to help my group in every way possible for the assignment. I am pretty much new in this environment had a tough time to cover up the studies and every other things to get settled here outside home. My group members have been very co-operative and helped me with guidelines for the assignment for which I could do my part of the job perfectly and comfortably. We were connected in social media (facebook) through which we discussed almost everyday bit by bit about our work and responsibilities for the assignment. We had a group meeting as well in which we each gave 4 hours of our time to finish up the whole work and pack up. I have tried my best to help my members out with my hard work. I have written a report on robots for the IT technologies part. For the group reflection part, I took charge and collect everyones reflection and collaborate it through GitHub Desktop and linked with the original GitHub link for the final touchup of the assignment. Working with this group under great minds and leadership I had an wonderful experience and would like to continue doing work with this group for the next assignment.

                        I would first like to start by saying that working with my group has been an enjoyable and new experience for me. Although we started working on the assignment late due to a couple of issues, we managed to complete the assignment without much problems. I would like to thank Daniel as he filled me in with what the group was doing when I was sick. Besides that, I felt that he did not give me any pressure to complete the work and that was very relieving for me especially when I was very ill. We did most of our communication through Facebook as well as meeting in classes to discuss about the assignment. I believe that everyone played a huge role in helping to complete this assignment. This has definitely been one of the better groups I have worked with during my time  studying in RMIT and I would love to complete assignment 3 with the same group.

                        In my opinion, the group functioned well albeit some delays with starting the assignments. The assignment was able to be completed on time although we had very few group meetings and discussions were mostly done on Facebook. Although I’ve missed a few classes, Daniel was able to get me up to date and explain the work required for my part in the assignment, making it less stressful for me as I have other assignments that are due on the same week. Everyone communicated and worked together well with one another to complete the assignment on time. Daniel was a big help to the group as he was able to organise everyone and delegate task to each individual. This is one of the better group that I have worked with so far in my 3 years in uni and I’m looking forward to working together with the group to complete assignment 3.

                        I had a good experience working with this group. One of my fellow groupmates is from Malaysia, which is my home country. Coincidentally, he is also my senior from high school. So, I felt comfortable when joining the group. I joined the group late because I was absent from class when the group was formed. Nonetheless, everyone was very welcoming. We started off by dividing the work among all the members. Everyone was given a task to complete. Every Friday during tutorial, we would discuss on what we have done or completed. We will help each other with the assignment. Everyone was very hardworking in doing their task. I was given the task of completing the “Project Ideas” of our assignment. The task was to find similarities between our project ideas from Assignment 1 or solve current Information Technology problems in the world. Since all of our project ideas are different from each other, I have decided to solve current Information Technology problems. There were some difficulties when doing the assignment but the other members helped me. As a group, we progressed well throughout the assignment. I would like to continue working with this group for the upcoming assignment.
