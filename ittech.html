      Cyber security comprises of processes, technologies and controls that are designed to protect networks, systems and data from cyber attacks. Cyber security helps in effectively protects individuals and organisations from the unauthorised exploitation of systems, networks and technologies as well as reducing the risk of cyber attacks. Cyber attacks can cause reputation and financial damage that to organisations which can result in a loss of assets, business as well as potential regulatory fines and litigation.

Hardware authentication:

It is a well-known fact that usernames and passwords used by a majority of data users are weak. This makes it easy for hackers to gain access to information systems and compromise sensitive data of a government agency or business entity. A new Core vPro processor that belongs to the sixth generation of processors has been developed as a solution in the user authentication process. For user identity validation purposes, the core vPro is able to combine different types of hardware components with enhanced factors simultaneously. Intel has dedicated a portion of the processor for security reasons in order to make a device part of the entire process of authentication. When it comes to the Internet of Things (IoT) where the network of connected devices ensures that any device that seeks to be connected has the rights for connectivity to that particular network, hardware authentication can be especially important.

Cloud Technology:

The cloud has a significant impact on the transformation of systems security technology. The number of business enterprises and government agencies that have embraced cloud technology to store the vast amounts of information that they generate on a daily basis has increased. More approaches to information systems security that will be developed for use in the cloud.  In addition to that, techniques for on-premise data storage will be migrated to the cloud as components such as virtualized intrusion detection and prevention systems, virtualised systems   security and virtualised firewalls are used from the cloud as opposed to traditional forms.

Deep Learning:

Deep learning are encompassed in certain technologies, such as artificial intelligence and  machine learning. Deep learning focuses on anomalous behaviour just like behaviour analytics. AI and machine learning systems are able to make decisions on how to prevent hacks without any human input whenever they are fed with the right data regarding potential systems security threats. Instead of users, the system scrutinises entities that have access to the information system. Different entities that are found in the enterprise at both the macro and the micro levels can now be analysed due to the recent developments in machine learning technology. Business organisations and government agencies are now able to overcome any advanced cyber threats through the usage of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

	The use of AI can help in bolstering cybersecurity and offering more protections against sophisticated hackers. AI helps by automating complex processes for reacting to breaches and detecting attacks. As AI is deployed for security, the applications are becoming more sophisticated. Data deception technology are able to automatically detect, analyse, and defend against advanced attacks. By combining smart security personnel with adaptive technology that continuously change and become smarter over time, a competitive edge is gained by defenders that have been absent from most cybersecurity technologies.

	The tasks that require humans will become more valuable as machines begin to replace humans for certain jobs,. This automation will improve human capabilities and also make the creation of new products and services possible. As a result, labour demands will shift as new jobs replace the old ones, the labour force will require time to adapt to changing demands and gain new skills. A period of increasing unemployment in the time it takes for humans to adapt to new needs will likely be observed.

	 Siri a machine learning speech recognition program that is designed to let us talk to the internet and interface with the data it contains without the usage of a keyboard. Siri’s deep learning algorithms have allowed the program to overcome our idiosyncratic speech patterns in order to understand us which in turn helps us access the information we desire more efficiently.

	“Targeted advertising” is an example of how machine learning is affecting our daily lives as it is inundating us with social media advertising which seems to know a bit more about our shopping habits and online activities than we are ready to completely accept. For example,  it is not a coincidence, when we log on to Facebook and see advertising for hotels in the same Spanish city, which we were just reading about.

	Machine learning is designed for "action and reaction" industries. Systems are able to in fact act more quickly upon receiving outputs of machine learning thus making marketing message more effective. For instance, organisations may be able to propel their business with newly obtained data which an present new offers for geo-based or specific customers. For conversion purposes, unnecessary offers can also be cut back if the customers do not require them. This can be seen as a form of learning from past behaviours thus enabling them to continuously improve on predictions according to new incoming datas.

	An industry that uses machine learning is the medical industry where hospitals use data analysis techniques in order to predict hospital admission rates. It can also be used by physicians to predict the amount of time a patient with fatal disease can live. Likewise, machine learning is being incorporated into medical systems to hep with cost cutting measures as well as centralising and streamlining testing protocols and expense reports. In fact, experts believe that the work of a radiologists may one day be replace by computer algorithms that continuously process and churn data.
