<p>Cyber security comprises of processes, technologies and controls that are designed to protect networks, systems and data from cyber attacks. Cyber security helps in effectively protects individuals and organisations from the unauthorised exploitation of systems, networks and technologies as well as reducing the risk of cyber attacks. Cyber attacks can cause reputation and financial damage that to organisations which can result in a loss of assets, business as well as potential regulatory fines and litigation.</p>

<h1>Hardware authentication:</h1>

<p>It is a well-known fact that usernames and passwords used by a majority of data users are weak. This makes it easy for hackers to gain access to information systems and compromise sensitive data of a government agency or business entity. A new Core vPro processor that belongs to the sixth generation of processors has been developed as a solution in the user authentication process. For user identity validation purposes, the core vPro is able to combine different types of hardware components with enhanced factors simultaneously. Intel has dedicated a portion of the processor for security reasons in order to make a device part of the entire process of authentication. When it comes to the Internet of Things (IoT) where the network of connected devices ensures that any device that seeks to be connected has the rights for connectivity to that particular network, hardware authentication can be especially important.</p>

<h1>Cloud Technology:</h1>

<p>The cloud has a significant impact on the transformation of systems security technology. The number of business enterprises and government agencies that have embraced cloud technology to store the vast amounts of information that they generate on a daily basis has increased. More approaches to information systems security that will be developed for use in the cloud.  In addition to that, techniques for on-premise data storage will be migrated to the cloud as components such as virtualized intrusion detection and prevention systems, virtualised systems   security and virtualised firewalls are used from the cloud as opposed to traditional forms.</p>

<h1>Deep Learning:</h1>

<p>Deep learning are encompassed in certain technologies, such as artificial intelligence and  machine learning. Deep learning focuses on anomalous behaviour just like behaviour analytics. AI and machine learning systems are able to make decisions on how to prevent hacks without any human input whenever they are fed with the right data regarding potential systems security threats. Instead of users, the system scrutinises entities that have access to the information system. Different entities that are found in the enterprise at both the macro and the micro levels can now be analysed due to the recent developments in machine learning technology. Business organisations and government agencies are now able to overcome any advanced cyber threats through the usage of artificial intelligence and machine learning.</p>


<a href= "https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/featured/emerging-technology-cyber-security/"> Development in Cybersecurity</a>

<p>The use of AI can help in bolstering cybersecurity and offering more protections against sophisticated hackers. AI helps by automating complex processes for reacting to breaches and detecting attacks. As AI is deployed for security, the applications are becoming more sophisticated. Data deception technology are able to automatically detect, analyse, and defend against advanced attacks. By combining smart security personnel with adaptive technology that continuously change and become smarter over time, a competitive edge is gained by defenders that have been absent from most cybersecurity technologies.</p>

<a href= "https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2018/02/15/how-will-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-impact-cyber-security/#1ac65c9b6147"> Usage of AI</a>

<p>The tasks that require humans will become more valuable as machines begin to replace humans for certain jobs,. This automation will improve human capabilities and also make the creation of new products and services possible. As a result, labour demands will shift as new jobs replace the old ones, the labour force will require time to adapt to changing demands and gain new skills. A period of increasing unemployment in the time it takes for humans to adapt to new needs will likely be observed</p>

<a href= "https://www.newsclick.in/what-jobs-can-machine-learning-replace">Effects of Introduction of AI</a>


<p>Siri a machine learning speech recognition program that is designed to let us talk to the internet and interface with the data it contains without the usage of a keyboard. Siri’s deep learning algorithms have allowed the program to overcome our idiosyncratic speech patterns in order to understand us which in turn helps us access the information we desire more efficiently.</p>

<p>“Targeted advertising” is an example of how machine learning is affecting our daily lives as it is inundating us with social media advertising which seems to know a bit more about our shopping habits and online activities than we are ready to completely accept. For example,  it is not a coincidence, when we log on to Facebook and see advertising for hotels in the same Spanish city, which we were just reading about.</p>

<p>Machine learning is designed for "action and reaction" industries. Systems are able to in fact act more quickly upon receiving outputs of machine learning thus making marketing message more effective. For instance, organisations may be able to propel their business with newly obtained data which an present new offers for geo-based or specific customers. For conversion purposes, unnecessary offers can also be cut back if the customers do not require them. This can be seen as a form of learning from past behaviours thus enabling them to continuously improve on predictions according to new incoming datas.</p>

<p>An industry that uses machine learning is the medical industry where hospitals use data analysis techniques in order to predict hospital admission rates. It can also be used by physicians to predict the amount of time a patient with fatal disease can live. Likewise, machine learning is being incorporated into medical systems to hep with cost cutting measures as well as centralising and streamlining testing protocols and expense reports. In fact, experts believe that the work of a radiologists may one day be replace by computer algorithms that continuously process and churn data.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2014/11/17/a-robot-future-developing-technologies-hopes-and-fears/id=52183/.">What can robots do?</a></p>
    <p>
      Robots are electronic devices that are programmed to do a task or tasks that humans may do, ranging from simple industrial robots that help to package products to adaptive robots that can make complex decisions. Most robots will have a method to input, process and output data usually in the form of movement. They also require a physical body and a power supply to run on. There are some robots that are simple and some that are very complex. Robots are designed to do tasks that people may or not be able to do for themselves. They are used to build cars, dismantle bombs, pack-boxes, answer phones, mow yards, explore deep sea ship wrecks and many other things. It’s important to note that robotics technologies may have only reached some level of maturity in recent years, but they’ve existed in the popular imagination for generations, and in some cases even millennia. Today, our world is fairly close to realizing some of the more idealistic aspects of robotics. Walking robots that can communicate verbally with their human owners are a long way off yet, but there are commercially available robots to help with a variety of home tasks. Artificial intelligence has been programmed into vacuum cleaners, non-humanoid personal assistants and even self-cleaning litter boxes. Robots can be programmed not only to perform tasks that we don’t want to complete but also to perform jobs that humans can’t alone. This latter concept is why hospitals and medical facilities may be the setting for more great development in robotics in the coming years. </p>
       <p><a href= "http://thescienceexplorer.com/technology/meet-valkyrie-robot-being-developed-nasas-future-mars-mission.">Technology and Valkyrie</a></p>
      <p>At the Edinburgh Centre for Robotics, work has begun on developing one of the most advanced humanoids on the planet, Valkyrie, a robot which will be used in a future NASA mission to explore the surface of the red planet, Mars. “Valkyrie is a huge scientific undertaking. The researchers are looking forward to tackling the many technical challenges involved in developing a large-scale humanoid robot, and pushing the state of the art in humanoid robotics”. At the moment the robot is a pretty basic shell which can walk up a set of three small steps and can reach out and grip something and pass it on to someone. It reacts if pushed against it, either swaying or taking a step back. The big challenge will be getting Valkyrie to interact with people; it has to has some pretty adaptable algorithms. The main target is to have something that can be a co-worker for astronauts on space missions, for example. Scientists at the University of Edinburgh working on the 6-foot (1.8-meter) tall robot that weighs just under 280 pounds (125 kilograms), hope Valkyrie will be ready for a mission to Mars in as little as five years. Valkyrie is designed to work more readily alongside people that could accompany the robot in future missions. For example, there would be no need for specialized ramps onboard spacecraft to accommodate robot wheels. Valkyrie can walk just like humans, Valkyrie is currently equipped with a pair of stereoscopic cameras, which the robot will use as eyes to explore the surroundings. It contains cameras on its belly, adding additional visual input, as well as a set of sensors that will be sensitive to pressure and touch, allowing Valkyrie to respond to changes if needed. Valkyrie doesn’t have any ears and cannot speak, but is equipped with a special sensory laser radar that’s housed in its face. The laser radar can be used to measure the distances of objects by firing pulses of light towards surfaces and then calculating the time it takes for the light to reflect back, like an echo.</p>

      <p><a href="https://sciencing.com/info-8478847-kind-do-robots-make-humans.html.">Likely Impact</a></p>
      <p>Rapid advances in computer technology and robotics have resulted in the increasing use of robots in science, medicine and industry. The impact these robots have had on humanity have been both positive and negative. Given the rapid pace of technology, robots will likely have an even greater impact on humans in the future. The practical use of robots in manufacturing has been ongoing since the latter part of the 20th century, with robots used on assembly lines, manufacturing products such as automobiles, food and drugs. Robots have also served scientific purposes, such as the robotic arm, used by Endeavor, a NASA space shuttle. The use of robots in manufacturing has both positive and negative effects. Robots can be used to perform dangerous tasks that would put a person at risk if he were to undertake them, which is clearly beneficial. On the other hand, robots are increasingly being used in place of human workers. Although this can yield higher profits for the manufacturer, the increased unemployment this creates is likely to have a negative effect on the economy as a whole. According to Marshall Brain, author of "Robot Nation" essays, the use of robots will increase substantially in the coming years. Robots will be used to perform jobs currently being done by humans, such as airline pilots, baggage handlers and retail checkout clerks. Brain foresees a "robot nation" in which systems will no longer require any human supervision or intervention, with robots repairing and manufacturing other robots. Brain anticipates the impact on the U.S. economy could be devastating. A scenario in which robots create robots has long intrigued science fiction writers, in which high-tech robots are typically depicted as malevolent entities intent on destroying or enslaving humanity. </p>

      <p>The way developments of robots are increasing in our society it is quite sure that within 2025 the world will be covered by robots. The workers will be replaced by robots due to the preciseness and the accuracy of the robots compared to humans. Robots are already working in our everyday lives and have changed the way that some industries operate. They can entertain us and they can help us in certain tasks. The robots do not require to sleep or take breaks. They are able to function without stopping. When employed to carry out dangerous tasks, the risk to the human health & safety is reduced. They can work long time without service or maintenance and they can be more productive than the people. It cannot tremble or shake as the human hands do. They can have much smaller & versatile moving parts than the people. They have performed the medical surgeries because they can be faster and more precise than the people. The robots can do the jobs that the people are unwilling to do, many robotic probes have been sent throughout the solar system to never return back to Earth. They can be stronger than the people. On the other hand focusing  on the bad sides it can be said that robots will affect our lives negatively in a multiple ways as  robots can take the place of many humans in the factories. So, the people have to find new jobs or be retrained. They can take the place of the humans in several situations. If the robots begin to replace the humans in every field. They will lead to unemployment. The robots cost much money in the maintenance & repair. In case of the breakdown, the cost of repair may be very high. They do not have emotions or conscience. This limits how the robots can help & interact with people. Although the lifestyle will be different but the consequences that we will face is beyond repair. </p>
      
      
      <p><a href="http://idahoptv.org/sciencetrek/topics/robots/facts.cfm">How this will affect me?</a></p>
      
      <p>Imagine if your job was to tighten one screw on a toaster. And you did this over and over again on toaster after toaster, day after day, for weeks, months, or years. This kind of job is better done by robots than by humans. Most robots today are used to do repetitive actions or jobs considered too dangerous for humans. A robot is ideal for going into a building that has a possible bomb. Robots are also used in factories to build things like cars, candy bars, and electronics. Robots are now used in medicine, for military tactics, for finding objects underwater and to explore other planets. Robotic technology has helped people who have lost arms or legs. Robots are a great tool to help mankind. So, a lazy guy like me will always prefer having robots to help me and won’t be that much of a disadvantage for me as I am willing to programming in future so won’t give those robots a chance to kill my employment opportunities in the future.</p>
