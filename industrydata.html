    <h1>Ideal Jobs</h1>

    <p>My group members have a wide variety of ideal jobs that we all plan to work in the future. Among the ideal jobs are working as a ecommerce Marketing Coordinator, working as a game developer in a growing company, working as a junior level IT professional, working as a programmer, working as a principle consultant for Microsoft Solutions and finally as a key accounts manager for an ecommerce company. My group has a wide range of ideal jobs. The top two IT jobs from the months of February and March in 2018 are a solutions architect as well as a graphic designer. In terms of ideal jobs of my group members, the programmer position would be in the highest demand from employers. According to Burning Glass, the data collected is active selections from the last 365 days in Australia and New Zealand. The developer programmer role had 7,952 active selections during the time period of May 25, 2016 to May 24, 2017.</p>

<h1>IT-Specific Skills</h1>

  <p>Based on my group’s ideal jobs, there are a few skills that are required in order to be successful in the job. These skills can be separated into two categories, general skills and IT-specific skills. In terms of IT-specific skills, I have narrowed down to a   couple of relevant skills based on my group member’s ideal jobs. The first skill is being proficient in coding languages such as JavaScript, HTML and jquery. The next crucial skill that is needed is being able to use gaming engines such as UNITY 3D. Besides that, another important skill is being able to use Microsoft office products, such as Word and Excel. Finally, the last important skill is being able to use web developing programs such as Git. In terms of demand from employers, being able to use SQL and JavaScript seems to be the two of the most important IT-specific skills required. The three highest ranking IT-specific skills that is not a part of my group’s required skillset are Microsoft C# (7,716), LINUX (7,287) and Microsoft Windows (11,996). </p>

<h1>General Skills</h1>

<p>In terms of general skills, my group’s required skillset can be broken down into 5 main skills. The 5 main skills are teamwork, critical thinking, creativity, leadership and finally communication skills.  These skills are important to ensure that we are able to work in the jobs we have specified. In terms of demand from employers, the main skills required by employers are communication skills and problem solving skills. These skills are vital in any workplace. In terms of my group’s required skillset, communication and critical thinking rank high. The three highest ranking general skills that is not a part of my group’s required skillset are writing skills (13,687), organizational skills (13,896) and trouble shooting skills (10,406). I believe that these two skills will play a very important part in any job.</p>

<p>In conclusion, after reviewing the Burning Glass data, I believe that my opinion of my ideal job has not changed. This is because a majority of the skill set required is relevant to the demand of the employers based on the Burning Glass data. However, there are also a few important skills that are not a part of my group’s required skillset and may need to be addressed in the future.</p>
