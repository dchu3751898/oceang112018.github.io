        <h3> <span class="highlight">What's</span> my hobby? </h3>
        <p> There's nothing i love more than the smell of chlorine, swimming is my passion, i've been in the pool since the age of eight. I started off swimming due to the fact that i was asthmatic, i wasn't able to do much sports when i was young, there were countless of times that i was rushed to the nearest medical center to get breathing assistance. Having a go at swimming, i've enjoyed the pool eversince, being able to breath clearer over time, now the asthma is history. </p>
