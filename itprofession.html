    <p> Maxim Srour is a Software Implementations Officer at Solutions Three, a construction company situated in Burwood. The interview is in a casual style as Maxim and I (Lachlan) are friends from school. My questions will be marked L with Maxim’s responses marked M.
L: So, lemme just get the boring stuff out of the way, you are Maxim Srour, and you finished school in the class of 2015, and here you are working full time.
M: Well yeah actually not really, I was just fired last Friday, the 7th of September. 
L: Oh really how did that happen?
M: The construction company I worked for wasn’t making profit due to foreign investors screwing with the market, so they had to cut some people, and I was on the list.
L: Ah man that sucks.
M: Yeah I clocked off work and the manager called me back for a chat, I saw HR in his office and I knew I was done. That being said I do have a new job lined up.
L: That’s good, tell me about that.
M: Whilst I was working at my old company, during my down time I would do some data management and excel spreadsheet stuff, automating them and that sort of thing. 
L: Well that’s cool, so you were doing that for money?
M: Yeah I was doing it for them in the name of the company I used to work for, they sorta did it as a favour. I called them and said hey do you want me to do that full time and the manager called back and said sure how much do you want to be paid? Haha
L: Well that’s pretty good, no interview necessary.
M: Yeah true, this is just an intermediary thing, short contract while I look for something else. 
L: Sounds like it’s a quickly moving profession.
M: Yeah not sure about that, I’m still pretty new to it but I think it’s more of a coincidence. I can get a longer more substantial contract, which is want I’m planning on doing.
L: Ok, lets get onto the real stuff. What sort of work to you do?
M: So my main thing is being a programmer, I’ve been doing it for about 9 years. During school I loved programming but I didn’t get into it seriously until maybe year 8 – I think that was 2011
L: Yeah I remember that year 8 was 2011 because that was when Skyrim came out
M: *laughs* good way to remember it. Yeah so in year 8 I started playing Minecraft, and that was when I really got into programming
L: Like using the redstone and all that? That seems more hardware and logic gates and stuff.
M: No, I mean actual modding of the game, I used to play with a lot of mods back in the day and still do when I play games. So I started to try make my own (pretty crappy) mods. I really did struggle at the time with Java, its hard getting(sic) progress as a kid just using youtube tutorials etc. I ended up pausing that for the time being, and I started learning HTML and CSS, because they were a lot easier to understand and it was a good entry point into Javascript which is what I then started learning.
L: And how far into HTML were you when you started getting back into Java? Had you sort of mastered it or just got the hang of it or?
M: Yeah so I’d just been playing around with making websites and stuff, so I’d definitely got the hang of it but wouldn’t say mastered, as I find HTML is really difficult to get a comprehensive mastery of, not because it’s really difficult per se, it’s just really quirky.
L: So what do you actually do in your job
M: So my job title was software implementation officer, and my job was to do with implementing an ERP (enterprise resource planning) software system for the company which is essentially a database/management software which would handle all facets of the construction pipeline. That would be everything from receiving a request for a quote to actually getting the quotation done, constructing planning like figuring out the dates and pulling up the project management plans etc. This program made life easier for all the project managers and admins.
That was what I did in my official job description, but a lot of what I did in my down time was automation and, to put It in layman terms, making excel sheets good.
L: That’s what we talked about before right?
M: Yeah, but I did that excel stuff for the company of course. They’d give me all the quotation details, something like 40 columns and about a thousand rows
L: wow 
M: Yeah, and that’s not even the most I’ve worked with. 
L: That must get boring at times
M: Nah I love it
L: Fair enough, are you the sort to enjoy the mathematical precision of things
M: Yeah, and like the problem-solving stuff too. One time I had to make an employee scheduling sheet, trying to implement that into excel was very difficult, first I had to get a weekly timetable read-out, what times they’re blocked out for and stuff like that. Then I had to try to automate as much off the process so none of the managers could go in and break anything. So the way I did that was essentially programmed an entire UI system so that you just press one button, type in the details and press enter, and does everything automatically, calculates everything, puts all the information where it needs to go.
L: Alright that is excellent, so you’d say you mostly interact with the higher-ups within the construction company you worked for.
M: Yeah definitely. Mostly white-collar workers.
L: Where do you spend most of your time?
M: Yeah so pretty much all my time is spent at my desk, or sometimes a half an hour chat with my boss about the project I’m working on
L: Yeah fair enough, I don’t really know what I expected from that question.
M: *laughs* well sometimes I’d spend some time at the IT support desks helping them out with whatever problems they have. The company I worked for hired out a separate company to do their IT stuff, which is why I was the only IT guy employed directly.
L: Ok that’s good, what would you say is the most challenging part of, let’s say both your job and the industry as a whole, interacting with other people with different jobs and skillsets or finding work or whatever else.
M: Ok so I’d say the hardest thing with my job is trying to get information out of people. So what I mean by that is, say someone asks me to do a project, say from before, with the employee scheduling thing. They’d tell me they want that, and I’ll come back later with a prototype, and they’d say “oh that’s actually not what I wanted, I was thinking more like ____” so pretty much trying to get the specific details of what they want, and I’ll ask them to be specific but they’ll often leave out details they think are irrelevant or superfluous but which are actually important and relevant to the program they want. One example I can make is with the employee scheduling, they tell me that they want a way to add employees into the database and upon explaining it they make it say they want to be able to type employee names directly into the excel sheet, and obviously that doesn’t really require a fancy program at all, but when I can them the final prototype they’d say they don’t like that, they want to do it from within my UI system I made before, but not for the employee adding part(which is the complete opposite of what they said they wanted a week earlier. So I had to go back again and re-do everything.
L: So would you say that’s due to their lack of understanding of how computers and programs work?
M: Umm kind of, its something referred to as scope creep in the industry, which is basically, when you’re starting out a project you’ll get a set of requirements that you have to meet, and you have to allocate all the resources like employee time and money required to get the job done. The problem arises when later down the track they start asking for more stuff, which can sometimes be really easy stuff like adding a side bar on a website, but other times it can be something that requires a redesign of the entire system to be able to include it. So that is essentially the hardest part of my job, trying to avoid scope creep and push out a project on time. By making sure I’ve asked the right questions as to what they want out of the project. There are two ways to do this. The first and I suppose naïve way, is to flat out say no to every request after you’ve started the project. The problem with doing that is you’ll invariably reduce client satisfaction. The best way to get around that is to squeeze out every little bit of information you can from your client as to what they want and everything they could want.
L: Alright, well I think that about does us, thanks very much Maxim, I’m sure I’ll talk to you again soon. 
M: No worries bro, Ciao
