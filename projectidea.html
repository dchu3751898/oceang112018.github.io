      This project emphasizes on the union between gaming and studying. The gamification of education. There's a trend among students no matter what lessons or subjects they've came across there will always be a moment where studying feels like a chore instead of enjoying and learning the material to the fullest. As a student, I’ll like to create an environment where studying is enjoyable.

    <p>
      In the past, I never could grasp the concept of chemistry, the bonding between elements and the rules of when elements could bond. Being unable to keep up with my class I lost the motivation to learn more. This idea is inspired by monster collecting games namely Pokémon tm and Digimon tm. Basically, this game would emphasize on the collection of different atoms from the periodic table of elements. Using different atoms to bond them under certain conditions creating molecules. This help student to learn how atoms work under different conditions. Students can trade among each other adding more types of molecules into their collections. Not only does this helps in the educating aspect, it also helps create a platform for socializing. Down the line, instead of being solely based on collecting different molecules there could be a challenge between different users using a random generated list of atoms and creating molecules from the list, higher atomic value / stronger bonds (depending on that round condition) give points accordingly. Concept inspired by the Scrabble tm word game. The atoms could be presented as accurately as possible drawing a creature with the same attribute or colour as the atoms or molecule to easily visualise how the atoms colour would be. To further the knowledge learnt from this game, we could locate the atoms at their respective location based on earth. (For example we could get the H2O molecule from a river). This is still a farfetched idea. There's still more ideas able to be added into the interactive side but for now these will be plentiful, if there's too much going on it'll feel too clustered and suffocating.

  <div class="accordion-content">
    <img src="./img/cpplogo.png" class="projectideapic"/>
    <p>
      Basic concept of programming preferably C++, understanding the fundamental of coding to be able to apply the game concept and code logically. Knowledgeable in both the Chemistry periodic table and bonding between atoms.

    <p>
    Through the research made, found out game maker would be the best medium for this game as using that program is not code intensive and easy to navigate through. Further down the line C++ would be able to help with the multiplayer concept of the game. There won't be much hardware needed to operate this game, just a computer will do.

  <div class="accordion-content">
    <img src="./img/paveway.png" class="projectideapic"/>
    <p>
      Paving way for future gamification of education. Creating a path for better and greater way of making education more interactive. This game would greatly enhance the way Chemistry is taught.

      Educational Game. Chemistry made easy. Collect all the different type of atoms from the periodic table of elements and learn how different atoms interact with each other.
