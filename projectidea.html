    <p> Information Technology Problem Solving (Project Ideas) 

 

One of the most common and current Information Technology problem in the world is Information Security. What is Information Security? Information Security is the state of being protected or guarded against unauthorized use of information, especially data. Why is Information Security considered as a major problem in the world today? Cyber criminals are finding new ways to hack into systems and attack the most private / sensitive networks in the world. This is called “Cyber-Attack”. 

There are many threats to Information Security. For example, cyber criminals use the social media as a pathway to enter various systems. Outdated security software is also a threat. Updating your security software regularly is very crucial in preventing malicious software from attacking your system. If the security software is not up to date, any new malicious software will not be detected by the security software. Besides that, lack of encryption will also allow cyber criminals to hack into the system. 

Solution 1: 

There are various ways to deal with Information Security threats. Information Security is a highly sensitive issue in the world today. Therefore, implementing laws and regulations can assist in solving or minimizing Information Security issues. Firstly, implementing laws and regulations help improve the protection of information and network data so that data breaches can be avoided.  

Solution 2: 

Besides that, one of the most common way to tackle Information Security issue is by installing Anti-Virus Software. However, many computer users still ignore the notification to update the Anti-Virus Software. When the software prompts you to download the new update, download it. Viruses and malicious software grow very rapidly, so Anti-Virus software requires constant updates to stay effective and relevant in preventing any data security breach.  

Solution 3: 

 Another way to deal with Information Security problem by establishing data security management platform. There are three categories for data security management. They are data storage, data processing and data application. Data storage is very important because it uses virtualization to store large amount of data. This involves data transmission. During the data transmission process, encryption provides strong protection for the data as well as preventing cyber-attacks. Data processing is also very important in preventing information security breaches. Cyber-attacks can be prevented by good and effective data processing technology such as stream processing. Stream processing is to analyze new data as soon as possible. Lastly, data application is essential for protection. An example of data application is the real time analysis engine. It includes cloud computing and statistics. Any attacks or potential threats can be detected with the help of analysis engine.
